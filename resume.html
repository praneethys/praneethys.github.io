  <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
  <p class="entry-description mb-3">
    I started off my career as a hardware engineer working on building computer
    chips. Aven was my first full stack software engineering role. I have been a
    practitioner of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI since 2018.
  </p>
  <p class="entry-description">
    Reflecting on my past experience objectively, having worked across multiple
    startups for the past 5+ years, I do excel in ambiguous environments. My
    strength also lies in quickly mastering unfamiliar technologies.

    Oh, I haven't used AI to generate any of the content here. This is all

      Having worked up & down the Computer technologies from low level hardware
      at Oracle(Sun Microsystems), Intel to building consumer financial
      applications, I have acquired technical depth in what I do. I wanted to
      expand my wings and gain more breadth. This is when I started to do series
      of contracts with early-stage startups as a hands-on software architect,
      full-stack engineer, and a technical leader advising C-level executives on
      engineering roadmap and strategy.

      Joined here straight out of college. I was in SPARC Architecture Group in
      their Workloads Analysis & Performance Correlation team. There were many
      veteran engineers in the team. They were are highly intellectual, people
      who have worked their all their careers.

      The code base was mostly written in C and bit of C++. Not a lot of object
      oriented programming. The design patterns were very archaic and not how a
      modern software engineer would write code. I realized this when I went to
      inteview at Apple and failed miserably.

    <p class="entry-description">
      But I must say, I learned a lot from them and made friends for life.

      I was an intern in the Formal Verification team at Intel. Honestly, there
      was not much to do. They were too deep in re-architecting their code base
