  <h2 class="section-heading">The Six Schools of Vedanta</h2>
  <p class="entry-description mb-3">
    Vedanta, meaning "the end of the Vedas i.e., complete knowledge of the
    Veda," represents the philosophical conclusions drawn from the Upanishads.
    Over centuries, different teachers interpreted these ancient texts in their
    own ways, leading to the formation of distinct schools of thought. While
    they all draw from the same source textsprimarily the Upanishads, Brahma
    Sutras, and Bhagavad Gitatheir conclusions about the nature of reality, the
    self, and liberation (moksha) vary quite dramatically.
  </p>
  <p class="entry-description">
    What I find fascinating is how each school emerged as a response to the
    interpretations that came before it. They weren't created in isolation but
    through vigorous debate and philosophical inquiry. Here's my understanding
    of the six major schools:

      stance: there is only one reality, Brahman, and everything else is maya
      (illusion). The individual soul (atman) and the universal soul (Brahman)
      are not two different thingsthey're identical. Our perception of

    </p>

    <p class="entry-description mb-3">
      Ramanuja couldn't accept Shankara's idea that the world is just an
      illusion. He argued for a more inclusive view: Brahman is real, the world
      is real, and individual souls are real. Butand this is the keythey're not
      independent. The world and souls form the body of Brahman, inseparable yet
      distinct. Think of it like how your body and soul are different but not

      The world isn't an illusion or a mistake; it's Krishna's lila (divine
      play). Souls are parts of Brahman that have become covered by ignorance,

    What strikes me about these schools is that they're all trying to answer the
    same fundamental questions: Who am I? What is reality? How do I find
    liberation? But the diversity of their answers shows the richness of
    Vedantic inquiry. Shankara emphasizes pure knowledge, Ramanuja balances
    devotion and knowledge, Madhva centers on complete surrender to a
    transcendent God, and the later teachers explore various nuances of
    relationship with the divine.

    Each school has produced saints, scholars, and practitioners who found
    meaning and liberation through their respective paths. There's no
    universally accepted "correct" interpretationwhich, honestly, might be the
    beauty of it all.

    I'm still learning and my understanding keeps evolving. If you're interested
    in diving deeper, I'd recommend reading the original commentaries of these
    teachers rather than relying solely on secondary sources. The depth and
    subtlety of their arguments is something you only appreciate when you engage
    directly with their texts.
