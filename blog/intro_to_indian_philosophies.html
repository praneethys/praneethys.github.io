    Indian philosophy has a rich and diverse tradition spanning thousands of years. The philosophical systems developed in ancient India can be broadly classified into two major categories based on their acceptance or rejection of the Vedas as a source of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p class="entry-description">
    Before diving into these schools, it's essential to understand the foundational concept that underlies much of Indian philosophical thought: the Purusharthas, or the goals of human life.

    A key concept in understanding the structure of Indian philosophies is that of <span class="list-item-bold">purushartha</span> - the goals of mankind. These four objectives provide the framework for understanding what Indian philosophy considers the complete human experience:

  <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding the Classification</h2>
  <p class="entry-description mb-3">
    The distinction between orthodox and heterodox isn't about being "right" or "wrong"—it's simply a way of categorizing schools based on their relationship to Vedic authority. Many heterodox schools like Buddhism and Jainism share significant philosophical ground with orthodox schools, and there was extensive debate and mutual influence among all these traditions.
  </p>
  <p class="entry-description">
    What makes Indian philosophy fascinating is this diversity of viewpoints, all rigorously argued and systematically developed. Each school offers a unique perspective on fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, ethics, and liberation. Understanding this landscape gives you a foundation for exploring any particular school in depth.
